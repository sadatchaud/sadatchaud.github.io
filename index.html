            <h1>Sadat Tashkin</h1>
            <p> My name is Sadat Tashkin Chaudhury. I believe the key to happiness is to see
                success in failures. For example, I got a 36 in Functions 11 but I was able to look
                past that and see that math wasn't for me. Then I went into environental physics just to
                realize I didnt like physics either. I was in that program for a day and switched into 
                business and now I'm trying to get into management. Funny thing is there is no end to the math.
                Its ironic isn't it? Life can really be a bitch. 3 times I tried Calc 1 and finally I think (haven't
                checked acorn yet) I passed. Now I'm one step closer to management. In my free time and my busy time
                I enjoy watching anime and netflix. The thing that sucks is while peoples course loads decrease in time
                mine will be increasing. From  courses in first semester to 4 in second semester to 5 in the summmer.
                This is more like engineering than business. To celebrate this semester(and my cousin's wedding) I went to Bangladesh 
                and there I learned to pose in photos thanks to my cousins. Well the break is over for most people but not me. I still
                have until the 11th. So heres to the rest of my well deserved break. If you're wondering where I am, I am nicely 
                sandwiched between my 2 favourite people in the world.
